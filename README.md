## Description

This work aims to apply interpretability techniques on a convolutional neural network for glaucoma detection in fundus images.

The chosen neural network model was [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

The interpretability techniques used were [Grad-CAM](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130140) and [LRP](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11263-019-01228-7).

## Dataset

For training and validation, two public datasets were used: [Acrima](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CNNs_for_Automatic_Glaucoma_Assessment_using_Fundus_Images_An_Extensive_Validation/7613135) and [Rim-One](https://github.com/miag-ull/rim-one-dl). Additionally, another dataset was created by merging images from the two public datasets.
